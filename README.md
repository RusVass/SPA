## 🔍 Search logic

- Input supports multiple keywords separated by spaces or commas
- Articles are filtered if **at least one keyword** matches:
  - Title
  - Description
- Ranking priority:
  1. Matches in title
  2. Matches in description
- Highlighting is applied to matched words only

---

## 🧠 State management

State is managed using **React Context + useReducer**:
- Articles list
- Search query
- Loading state
- Error handling

This approach keeps the logic predictable and easy to scale.
